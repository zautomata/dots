HOW TO USE
----
This filter snippet is the only unit for building software
applications and utilities, may be used to create two kinds of
POSIX complied executables:

1) Domain-specific App:
Must do its thing via pipelines, that include any number of general
purpose utilities.

Pipelines may include:
- Data Converters e.g. `jq `
- Datastore Commands e.g. `redis-cli set mykey myvalue`
- Datastore Queries e.g. `redis-cli get mykey`
- General Purpose Utitilies

2) General Purpose Utility:
Utilities are self-contained code artifacts, that may never do its
thing via pipelines, however may aquire its needed data via STDIN
from other unix utilities.

does a specific refinment

This filter snippet follows the recommendations of the
'Pipe and Filter pattern from the book of Archiectural software
patterns, by that it encapsulates its operations into the following
functions:
- refine();
- transform();
- enrich();
This not only exhibits a desired readability quality of all produced
code artifacts but also helps -enforces- better design practices.

By limiting code-artifacts reuse to two levels, technical debt is
to remain reasonablly under control.

In the regular software engineering scenario, communication with
a Client should involve discussing:
- No. of Domain-specific Apps
- No. of Pipelines in each Domain-specific App
- No. of General Purpose Utilities
- DateStorage e.g. Redis
- Logging Policies

LOGGING SEVERITY LEVELS
----
0 Emergency     - emerg
1 Alert         - alert
2 Critical      - crit
3 Error         - err
4 Warning       - warning
5 Notice        - notice
6 Informational - info
7 Debug         - debug

INCODE DOCUMENTATION
---
Each pipeline should be thoroughly documented specifiying the its
filters, error handling, and the output.
